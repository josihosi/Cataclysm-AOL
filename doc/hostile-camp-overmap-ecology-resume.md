# Hostile-camp overmap ecology resume packet

Updated: 2026-08-02

## Repository state

- Active worktree: `/Users/josefhorvath/Schanigarten/Cataclysm-AOL-hostile-ecology-dev`
- Active branch: `dev`
- Launch base: `660057ff728bdf77531f607b1bd42a175f027a5f`
- Untouched release/playtest worktree: `/Users/josefhorvath/Schanigarten/Cataclysm-AOL`
- Untouched release/playtest branch: `port/cdda-master` at exact launch base
- Prior branch tips: `backup/dev-pre-hostile-ecology-20260802` and `backup/master-pre-hostile-ecology-20260802`
- The checkpoint containing this file is the authoritative resume commit; resolve it with `git log -1 --format=%H` after checkout.

No push, publication, tag, release, upstream merge, Windows mutation, or production-candidate edit is authorized.

## Active execution state

- Goal: complete the engineering success state in `doc/hostile-camp-overmap-ecology-implementation-ledger-v0.md`.
- Active phase: Phase 0 - reproducible baselines and benchmark infrastructure.
- First execution row: record compiler, build flags, Mac model/OS, commit ID, season length, world seed, and test-binary identity.
- Scope: bandits and cannibals only. Writhing-stalker AI, zombie-rider AI/progression, and flesh-raptor behavior are excluded.
- Non-blocking release-harness gap: the guarded Security.framework write returned `OSStatus -25308` (`interaction not allowed`). The existing shell export remains intact; make no more Keychain attempts while Josef is unavailable.
- Current engineering state: the path classifier and writer defects are repaired and pass 60 contract tests. Final clean-environment secure-store/API qualification is deferred to the later release gate and may not pause deterministic camp-AI work.

## Launch evidence

- The clean production checkout and `origin/port/cdda-master` both resolved to `660057ff728bdf77531f607b1bd42a175f027a5f`.
- No relevant transfer, build, port-orchestrator, or separate implementation process was active.
- Launch configuration reported GPT-5.6-sol, xhigh reasoning, approval `never`, and unrestricted sandboxing. Persistent service tier was normalized to default.
- `/usr/bin/python3 -m unittest tools.openclaw_harness.test_fixture_contract` ran 57 tests and reproduced one failure plus one error: a mocked Windows `WindowsPath` construction on macOS and mocked Linux acceptance of the real Mac API venv.
- A release-candidate dry run with both API-key variables removed exited successfully and selected the Mac API venv; it did not make an API call.
- A read-only upstream merge-tree audit was saved at `/tmp/caol-hostile-camp-upstream-merge-tree-20260802.txt`; upstream remains unmerged.
- The repaired harness passes 60/60 fixture-contract tests plus `py_compile` and `git diff --check`.
- One guarded real Keychain write was attempted through Security.framework. It emitted no secret,
  returned `OSStatus -25308`, and wrote no item. Do not retry until Josef explicitly confirms the
  Mac login Keychain is unlocked/approved from a native local session.

## Resume procedure

1. Confirm `git status --short`, `git log -1 --format=%H`, and `git worktree list` before editing.
2. Read `Plan.md`, `SUCCESS.md`, `TODO.md`, `TESTING.md`, and the canonical implementation ledger.
3. Complete the active Phase-0 identity row and retain raw artifacts outside Git.
4. Do not retry Keychain or send another blocker message during this resume. Retain the shell export and leave the later release-harness secure-store/API row unchecked.
5. Audit the incomplete redirected tests-build log; no build process or test binary survived, so restart one redirected build only when required by the current baseline row.
6. Continue the remaining Phase-0 functional and benchmark baseline rows; do not begin gameplay changes before their required budgets are ratified.

Build state at resume: the behavior-unchanged Mac `tests` build is no longer running. Its redirected
log ends during compilation without a hard-error marker, and no test binary exists; treat it as
incomplete and restart only the one build required by the active baseline row.

Keychain/TCC/password interaction is not a whole-goal blocker for this deterministic package. A
future Apple prompt may pause only the later release-harness action that requires it; ordinary
technical failures and deferred API qualification must not stop the active ecology roadmap.
