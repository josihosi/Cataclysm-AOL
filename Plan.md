# Plan

Canonical roadmap for Cataclysm-AOL.

This file answers one question: **what should the agent advance next?**
It is not a changelog, not a graveyard of crossed-off substeps, and not a place to preserve every historical detour.
Rewrite it as reality changes.

## File roles

- **Plan.md** — canonical roadmap and current delivery target
- **SUCCESS.md** — success-state ledger / crossed-off exit criteria for roadmap items
- **TODO.md** — short execution queue for the current target only
- **TESTING.md** — current validation policy, latest relevant evidence, and pending probes
- **TechnicalTome.md** — durable mechanic notes, not daily state tracking
- **COMMIT_POLICY.md** — checkpoint rules to prevent repo soup

If these files disagree, **Plan.md wins** and the other files should be repaired.

## Working rules for agents

- Do **not** mechanically grab the first unchecked-looking thing from some list.
- Follow the current delivery target below and move it to its **next real state**.
- Josef being unavailable for playtesting is **not** a blocker by itself.
- When a target is waiting on Josef, move to the next best unblocked target.
- If no good unblocked target remains, send Josef a short parked-options note so he can greenlight the next lane; do not just keep revalidating the old packet.
- Prefer batching human-only asks where practical. One useful packet with two real product questions beats two tiny pings.
- Keep these files lean. Remove finished fluff from `TODO.md` and `TESTING.md` instead of piling up crossed-off archaeology.
- Each real roadmap item needs an explicit success state in `SUCCESS.md` (or an equally explicit inline auxiliary) so completion is visible instead of guessed.
- Cross off reached success-state items; only remove the whole roadmap item from `Plan.md` once its success state is fully crossed off / done.
- Prefer agent-side playtesting first. Josef should be used for product judgment, feel, priority calls, or genuinely human-only checks.
- Validation should match risk:
  - docs-only change -> no compile
  - small local code change -> narrow compile/test
  - broad or risky code change, or a Josef handoff -> broader rebuild / startup harness as needed
- Follow `COMMIT_POLICY.md`. Do not let the repo turn into one giant dirty blob.

## 1. Current delivery target — none (Patrol Zone v1 is closed)

**Status:** PARKED / WAITING FOR NEXT GREENLIGHT

Patrol Zone v1 is now done for now.
No other lane is currently greenlit in this file, so the repo is parked pending Josef's next pick.

### Current truth
- Patrol Zone v1 reached its close-out bar:
  - Zone Manager patrol zone + 4-way clustering landed
  - deterministic planner / shift-roster / interrupt contract landed
  - live disconnected-loop and connected-hold packets exist on the current binary
  - the packet now includes a tiny `probe.patrol_summary.txt` explainer so uncovered posts, connected-vs-disconnected behavior, and off-shift counts read without spelunking raw patrol trace logs
- The remaining lanes below are discussion / parked options, not silent auto-start work.

### Next greenlight options for Josef
1. **Smart Zone Manager v1** — start the explicit one-off basecamp auto-layout helper from `doc/smart-zone-manager-v1-aux-plan-2026-04-06.md`
2. **Locker Zone V3** — reopen exactly one narrow judgment slice instead of sliding back into locker-nuance soup
3. **Leave the repo parked** until a fresh hackathon or product call picks the next lane

## 2. Checkpointed — Patrol Zone v1

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

This lane is now considered done for now because the bundled success state in `SUCCESS.md` is checked:
- patrol zone surface + planner + sticky-shift contract exist
- deterministic hold-vs-loop runtime behavior exists
- current-binary live proof exists for disconnected-loop and connected-hold cases
- the packaged patrol packet is now legible enough to explain gaps / off-shift state without leaning on raw trace logs alone

If later code work or runtime evidence shows any one of those claims is false or incomplete, reopen Patrol Zone v1 immediately.

---

## 3. Checkpointed — Locker-capable harness restaging

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

This lane is now considered done for now because the bundled success state in `SUCCESS.md` is checked:
- a real locker-capable fixture/restaging path exists
- `locker.weather_wait` is no longer blocked on missing fixture shape
- a fresh packaged run reports **screen** / **tests** / **artifacts** separately
- the result is documented reviewer-cleanly as harness/fixture work on existing locker behavior

If later fixture drift, harness drift, or locker runtime evidence breaks any one of those bundled claims, reopen this lane immediately.

---

## 4. Checkpointed — Locker Zone V2

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

V2 is now considered done for now because the bundled V2 task set in `SUCCESS.md` is checked:
- managed ranged loadouts can pull up to two compatible magazines from locker supply
- selected compatible magazines can be topped off from locker-zone ammo and the supported weapon reloaded from that supply
- deterministic coverage exists for the V2 contract
- proportional runtime proof is recorded on the current binary

If later code work or runtime evidence shows any one of those bundled claims is false or incomplete, reopen V2 immediately.

---

## 5. Checkpointed — Locker Zone V1

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

V1 is only considered done because the bundled V1 task set in `SUCCESS.md` is fully checked.
That bundled close-out is meant to stop false completion:
- locker surface/control exists as a real zone-manager + camp-policy feature
- locker outfitting core exists as real planner/service behavior
- locker maintenance rhythm exists as real dirty/queue/reservation behavior
- V1 has deterministic + proportional runtime proof recorded

If later code work shows any one of those bundled claims is false or incomplete, reopen V1 immediately.

---

## 6. Checkpointed — post-Locker-V1 Basecamp follow-through

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

This queue reached its exit criteria for now:
- the board/job log packet is legible enough to compare against the deterministic router proof
- the deterministic board packaging is cleaner/upstream-friendlier
- the richer structured treatment now follows the board-emitted `next=` tokens instead of dropping straight back to spoken bark
- the testing/docs packet describes the closed state instead of an open queue

Keep this closed unless Josef explicitly reopens Basecamp prompt follow-through or a later change breaks the structured board/job lane again.

---

## 7. Checkpointed — LLM-side board snapshot path

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED

This slice reached its exit criteria for now:
- routing proof exists on the actual camp request router, not only on helper builders
- the richer structured/internal `show_board` lane is covered with deterministic evidence
- the short spoken board bark stayed separate
- the testing/docs packet can now describe current truth instead of an open routing question

Keep this out of the active queue unless later code changes break the route again or a new greenlit slice explicitly extends it.

---

## 8. Hackathon-reserved feature lanes — do not touch before the event

These are intentionally **reserved for the hackathon itself**.
They should stay visibly separate from the current repo-footing/harness work so reviewers do not mistake scaffolding for early feature implementation.

1. **Chat interface over in-game dialogue branches**
   - the future feature lane
   - current harness work may exercise nearby-NPC/freeform chat controls, but that is only test scaffolding and **not** this feature
2. **Tiny ambient-trigger NPC model**
   - the future feature lane
   - current harness work may stage weird-item scenarios and artifact checks, but that is only test scaffolding/observability and **not** this feature

Do not start them early, do not half-land them, and do not describe scaffolding as partial completion.

---

## 9. Documentation discipline

If the structure starts bloating again, apply this rule:
- `Plan.md` should be readable in a minute
- `TODO.md` should show only the current execution queue
- `TESTING.md` should show only current policy, latest relevant evidence, and pending probes
- `COMMIT_POLICY.md` should stop the dirty tree from becoming a lifestyle

If a sentence exists only to remember that something used to be true, it probably belongs in git history, not here.
