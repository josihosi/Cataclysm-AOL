# Plan

Canonical roadmap for Cataclysm-AOL.

This file answers one question: **what should the agent advance next?**
It is not a changelog, not a graveyard of crossed-off substeps, and not a place to preserve every historical detour.
Rewrite it as reality changes.

## File roles

- **Plan.md** — canonical roadmap and current delivery target
- **SUCCESS.md** — success-state ledger / crossed-off exit criteria for roadmap items
- **TODO.md** — short execution queue for the current target only
- **TESTING.md** — current validation policy, latest relevant evidence, and pending probes
- **TechnicalTome.md** — durable mechanic notes, not daily state tracking
- **COMMIT_POLICY.md** — checkpoint rules to prevent repo soup

If these files disagree, **Plan.md wins** and the other files should be repaired.

## Working rules for agents

- Do **not** mechanically grab the first unchecked-looking thing from some list.
- Follow the current delivery target below and move it to its **next real state**.
- Josef being unavailable for playtesting is **not** a blocker by itself.
- When a target is waiting on Josef, move to the next best unblocked target.
- If no good unblocked target remains, send Josef a short parked-options note so he can greenlight the next lane; do not just keep revalidating the old packet.
- Prefer batching human-only asks where practical. One useful packet with two real product questions beats two tiny pings.
- Keep these files lean. Remove finished fluff from `TODO.md` and `TESTING.md` instead of piling up crossed-off archaeology.
- Each real roadmap item needs an explicit success state in `SUCCESS.md` (or an equally explicit inline auxiliary) so completion is visible instead of guessed.
- Cross off reached success-state items; only remove the whole roadmap item from `Plan.md` once its success state is fully crossed off / done.
- Prefer agent-side playtesting first. Josef should be used for product judgment, feel, priority calls, or genuinely human-only checks.
- Validation should match risk:
  - docs-only change -> no compile
  - small local code change -> narrow compile/test
  - broad or risky code change, or a Josef handoff -> broader rebuild / startup harness as needed
- Follow `COMMIT_POLICY.md`. Do not let the repo turn into one giant dirty blob.

## 1. Current delivery target — Patrol Zone v1

**Status:** GREENLIT / ACTIVE

Josef has now greenlit **Patrol Zone v1**.
This is the next real lane.

Current job:
- implement a Zone Manager patrol zone as a real camp job with deterministic scheduling/coverage behavior
- follow `doc/patrol-zone-v1-patch-plan-2026-04-06.md`
- keep the implementation brutally simple, legible, and testable

### Immediate next move
- the topology spine, deterministic planner contract, sticky shift-roster / interrupt-whitelist contract, and deterministic on-map hold-vs-loop runtime order are landed:
  - patrol zone type
  - 4-way connected clustering
  - patrol-priority worker pool
  - day/night shift allocation for the reference staffing cases
  - shift-latched active roster that routine chores do not steal
  - urgent patrol breaks/backfill without full-roster reshuffle
  - fully staffed connected clusters hold distinct squares
  - understaffed or multi-post assignments walk a fixed 10-minute loop order
  - off-shift patrol workers fall back to ordinary camp downtime
- the first honest live patrol packet now exists with separate screen/tests/artifacts reporting for:
  - lone guard on disconnected posts
  - staffed connected cluster with distinct holders
- next tighten the **screen** evidence so the hold-vs-loop contrast reads clearly to a player without needing the artifact log to explain the screenshot
- keep watching for hallucinations, fake progress, and prose outrunning code/tests/live proof
- do **not** drift into smart-zone-manager cleverness during v1

### Later discussion topics once Patrol Zone v1 runs dry
1. reopen **Locker Zone V3** for one deliberately narrow next judgment slice
2. discuss/prototype a **smart zone manager**

## 2. Checkpointed — Locker-capable harness restaging

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

This lane is now considered done for now because the bundled success state in `SUCCESS.md` is checked:
- a real locker-capable fixture/restaging path exists
- `locker.weather_wait` is no longer blocked on missing fixture shape
- a fresh packaged run reports **screen** / **tests** / **artifacts** separately
- the result is documented reviewer-cleanly as harness/fixture work on existing locker behavior

If later fixture drift, harness drift, or locker runtime evidence breaks any one of those bundled claims, reopen this lane immediately.

---

## 3. Checkpointed — Locker Zone V2

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

V2 is now considered done for now because the bundled V2 task set in `SUCCESS.md` is checked:
- managed ranged loadouts can pull up to two compatible magazines from locker supply
- selected compatible magazines can be topped off from locker-zone ammo and the supported weapon reloaded from that supply
- deterministic coverage exists for the V2 contract
- proportional runtime proof is recorded on the current binary

If later code work or runtime evidence shows any one of those bundled claims is false or incomplete, reopen V2 immediately.

---

## 4. Checkpointed — Locker Zone V1

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

V1 is only considered done because the bundled V1 task set in `SUCCESS.md` is fully checked.
That bundled close-out is meant to stop false completion:
- locker surface/control exists as a real zone-manager + camp-policy feature
- locker outfitting core exists as real planner/service behavior
- locker maintenance rhythm exists as real dirty/queue/reservation behavior
- V1 has deterministic + proportional runtime proof recorded

If later code work shows any one of those bundled claims is false or incomplete, reopen V1 immediately.

---

## 5. Checkpointed — post-Locker-V1 Basecamp follow-through

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED / DONE FOR NOW

This queue reached its exit criteria for now:
- the board/job log packet is legible enough to compare against the deterministic router proof
- the deterministic board packaging is cleaner/upstream-friendlier
- the richer structured treatment now follows the board-emitted `next=` tokens instead of dropping straight back to spoken bark
- the testing/docs packet describes the closed state instead of an open queue

Keep this closed unless Josef explicitly reopens Basecamp prompt follow-through or a later change breaks the structured board/job lane again.

---

## 6. Checkpointed — LLM-side board snapshot path

**Status:** CHECKPOINTED

This slice reached its exit criteria for now:
- routing proof exists on the actual camp request router, not only on helper builders
- the richer structured/internal `show_board` lane is covered with deterministic evidence
- the short spoken board bark stayed separate
- the testing/docs packet can now describe current truth instead of an open routing question

Keep this out of the active queue unless later code changes break the route again or a new greenlit slice explicitly extends it.

---

## 7. Hackathon-reserved feature lanes — do not touch before the event

These are intentionally **reserved for the hackathon itself**.
They should stay visibly separate from the current repo-footing/harness work so reviewers do not mistake scaffolding for early feature implementation.

1. **Chat interface over in-game dialogue branches**
   - the future feature lane
   - current harness work may exercise nearby-NPC/freeform chat controls, but that is only test scaffolding and **not** this feature
2. **Tiny ambient-trigger NPC model**
   - the future feature lane
   - current harness work may stage weird-item scenarios and artifact checks, but that is only test scaffolding/observability and **not** this feature

Do not start them early, do not half-land them, and do not describe scaffolding as partial completion.

---

## 8. Documentation discipline

If the structure starts bloating again, apply this rule:
- `Plan.md` should be readable in a minute
- `TODO.md` should show only the current execution queue
- `TESTING.md` should show only current policy, latest relevant evidence, and pending probes
- `COMMIT_POLICY.md` should stop the dirty tree from becoming a lifestyle

If a sentence exists only to remember that something used to be true, it probably belongs in git history, not here.
