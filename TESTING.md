# TESTING

Current validation policy and current evidence only.

This file is not a trophy wall.
Remove stale or completed fluff instead of stacking crossed-off test history forever.

## Validation policy

Use the **smallest evidence that honestly matches the change**.

- **Docs-only change** -> no compile
- **Small local code change** -> narrow build and the narrowest relevant test target
- **Broad or risky code change** -> broader rebuild and relevant filtered tests
- **Before a Josef handoff** or after suspicious stale-binary behavior -> rebuild the real targets and rerun the real smoke path

### Agent vs Josef

Schani should do agent-side playtesting first whenever the harness or direct in-game probing can answer the question.
Josef should be asked only for:
- product judgment
- tone/feel
- human-priority choices
- genuinely human-only interaction

Josef being unavailable is **not** a blocker by itself.
Josef self-testing is **not** a plan blocker and does not belong in the active success state as a gate.
If Josef-specific checks are useful, write them down as non-blocking notes so he can run them later from his own list.
If another good agent-side lane exists, keep moving there.
If several human-only judgments are likely soon, batch them instead of sending tiny separate asks.

### Anti-churn rule

Do not keep rerunning the same startup or test packet when it is no longer the missing evidence class.
If startup/load is already green, and the missing proof is live behavior, then the next probe must target live behavior.
If a target is merely waiting on Josef, do not keep revalidating it unless the code changed.

## Current relevant evidence

### Locker Zone V1 / V2 baseline + V3 deterministic slice
Latest relevant agent-side locker packet:
- committed HEAD `10750acaad`
  - `make -j4 tests`
  - `./tests/cata_test "[camp][locker]"`
  - passed at `155 assertions in 11 test cases`
- the targeted suite still covers the bundled locker baseline from V1/V2 and now also proves the first landed V3 lane:
  - locker policy serialization / save-load
  - representative locker item classification
  - locker-zone candidate gathering and reservation filtering
  - locker loadout planning and disabled-category behavior
  - service / equip / upgrade / return behavior
  - one-worker-at-a-time queue sequencing plus dirty-trigger follow-through
  - transient assigned-camp downtime rehydration
  - `camp_locker_service_readies_ranged_loadouts_from_locker_supply`
    - managed ranged loadout starts empty
    - locker service counts the weapon’s inserted magazine as part of the two-magazine readiness budget
    - locker supply contributes only the additional compatible magazines needed to reach that cap
    - locker-zone ammo fills those selected magazines and reloads the supported weapon
    - leftover locker magazine count and ammo depletion stay deterministic
  - new V3 deterministic outerwear coverage in `camp_locker_loadout_planning`
    - explicit cold-temperature probe (`35 F`) prefers a warmer outerwear upgrade (`jacket_light -> coat_winter`)
    - explicit hot-temperature probe (`85 F`) prefers a lighter outerwear upgrade (`coat_winter -> jacket_light`)
    - scope is intentionally narrow: shirt/vest-slot outerwear that covers both torso and arms
- latest proportional runtime locker proof now covers the V1/V2 baseline **and** the first V3 outerwear-temperature lane:
  - `make -j4 tests`
  - `./tests/cata_test "[camp][locker]"`
  - `make -j4 TILES=1 cataclysm-tiles`
  - controlled cold probe on `dev` / `Sandy Creek`
    - staged **Bruna Priest** in `jacket_light` with `coat_winter` on the `CAMP_LOCKER` tile via the repo `./zzip` save tool, then loaded through `python3 tools/openclaw_harness/startup_harness.py start --profile dev --world 'Sandy Creek'`
    - harness load passed cleanly on `.userdata/dev/harness_runs/20260405_204703`
    - current `debug.log` on `d3b61027ec-dirty` emitted the real locker service packet:
      - `camp locker: before Bruna Priest ... temp_f=45.0 ... vest=[light jacket ... <jacket_light>] ... locker_raw=[puffer jacket (poor fit)<coat_winter>]`
      - `camp locker: plan for Bruna Priest ... changes=[... vest upgrade light jacket ... <jacket_light> -> puffer jacket (poor fit)<coat_winter> ...]`
      - `camp locker: after Bruna Priest ... vest=[puffer jacket (poor fit)<coat_winter>] ... locker=[... vest=[light jacket<jacket_light>] ...]`
  - controlled hot probe on the same save shape
    - restaged **Bruna Priest** in `coat_winter` with `jacket_light` on the locker tile, loaded through the harness, then forced `85 F` in the live debug temperature control before advancing to the next service window
    - the resulting live current-binary packet showed the planner re-queueing a lighter-outerwear swap:
      - `camp locker: before Bruna Priest ... vest=[puffer jacket ... <coat_winter>] ... locker_raw=[light jacket (poor fit)<jacket_light>]`
      - `camp locker: queued Bruna Priest state-dirty ... plan=[vest upgrade puffer jacket ... <coat_winter> -> light jacket (poor fit)<jacket_light>]`

Meaning:
- Locker Zone V1/V2 remain preserved under the new V3 code path at deterministic-suite level
- the first V3 outerwear-temperature lane now has both deterministic proof and proportional runtime proof on the current binary
- the hot-side runtime evidence currently comes from a real state-dirty replan packet after the live temperature flip rather than a second captured `after` packet, but it still proves the real planner/service path picks the lighter jacket when the temperature turns hot

## Pending probes

### Active queue — Locker Zone V3

1. choose the next narrow V3 clothing lane now that the first outerwear-temperature slice has live proof
   - likely shorts / hot-weather legwear
   - or a blanket / bedding-adjacent weather lane if that becomes easier to prove honestly
2. for that next slice, land deterministic coverage first and only then ask for the matching live packet
3. keep per-NPC personality nuance out unless a smaller deterministic clothing slice truly needs it

### Non-blocking Josef notes

None yet for Locker Zone V3.
If later needed, add V3 notes here without turning them into blockers.

## Reusable commands

Use these when they are actually the missing evidence, not as ritual.

### Narrow deterministic Basecamp bark / routing check
- `./tests/cata_test "[camp][basecamp_ai]"`

### Narrow deterministic locker check
- `./tests/cata_test "[camp][locker]"`

### Fresh full test rebuild on this Mac
- `make -j4 tests`

### Fresh tiles relink on this Mac
- `make -j4 TILES=1 cataclysm-tiles`

### Startup/load smoke
- `python3 tools/openclaw_harness/startup_harness.py start --profile dev --world 'Sandy Creek'`

## Local build caveat

On this Mac, treat top-level `make -j4 tests` as the reliable path for a fresh `cata_test`.
Avoid treating `make -C tests cata_test` as authoritative here; it has been a repeated source of toolchain/stale-build nonsense.
Also: if you actually need a fresh tiles binary, use `make -j4 TILES=1 cataclysm-tiles`; plain `make cataclysm-tiles` is not an honest rebuild path here.
